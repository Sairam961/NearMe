        <h2>Principal's Message</h2>
         <p>“It is never too late to be who you might have been.”- George Elliot Education in the Gen Z era is a challenge for the educationists around the globe. As educational leaders we have to open up our mind and alienate from the traditional approach to teaching and create room for new style in teaching which is centred around learning beyond texts, experiential learning and self-directed learning. Learning must be redefined with the use of technology and should envision a future ready generation.</p>

        <h2>The Adyar River</h2>
        
        <p>
            The Adyar River, which originates near the Chembarambakkam Lake in the Kanchipuram district, is one of the three rivers that winds through Chennai, Tamil Nadu, India, and joins the Bay of Bengal at the Adyar estuary. The 42.5-kilometre (26.4 mi) long river contributes to the estuarine ecosystem of Chennai. Despite the high pollution levels, boating and fishing take place in this river. The river collects surplus water from about 200 tanks and lakes, small streams and the rainwater drains in the city, with a combined catchment area of 860 square kilometres (331 sq mi). Most of the waste from the city is drained into this river and the Cooum. </p>
